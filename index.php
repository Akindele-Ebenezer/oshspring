    MAMA IS SO CLUELESSâ€¦
 
 
     "Didn't I tell you to stop throwing tantrums?"
 
  "Didn't I warn you of the consequences of what would happen if you failed?"
 
 She twisted my ears and I screamed in pain.
 
  "After all the money I waste yearly, you still bring trash as results to see, right?"
 
   I shook my head negatively. 
 
 "See your teacher's remark, it says you play all the time in the class. How can you do that? Let me tell you, if I see this result again", she hits her chest in a fury, "I'll skin you alive. Nonsense and ingredients, I pay money and you waste it. If it's easy, go out there and work after all,  you're old enough to do so. I try to make living comfortable for you but you return trash to me", she screamed her chest heaving. 
 
 "But mom", a voice more bold than intended, spoke out, "I didn't commit any crime, I only came second in class" I groaned, walking to my wardrobe to change my clothes. 
 
  Thanks to my mom, I have to learn to play violin, dance, go for French and Spanish lessons and still come first at school. Someone, tell this lady I'm not a robot, I'm human for crying out loud.
 
 "Young lady, you don't walk away when I'm talking to you, I'm not your father.  You'll respect ..."
 
 "And you can never be papa", I retorted and she was taken aback. 
 
 "You can never be like my father! He's not a manipulating, self-centered person like you who cares about her image outside than what I think of her. I am your daughter and not some robot, haaaa!" I screamed, throwing my hands in the air. She's pushed me to the wall and I have to retaliate. 
 
 "Areâ€¦ are youâ€¦ you talking to your mother in that manner?"
 
 It was obvious it shook her because I've been all obedient and never spoke out.
 
 "No ma'am, my mother would never put me through a death sentence because of her image. Because she wants to be worshipped", I spat.
 
  "Because her pride matters. You're just my passage into this world, you have never been and will never be my mother. If you'll excuse me, I have Spanish and French classes then I'll perfect my dancing steps before going to learn violin, then I'll go back for evening lessons yet not a compliment from you. You, who forced me to do these things. I wished father never died or he should have let me go with him too".
 
 I wished you weren't my mother 
 
 "Youâ€¦" I added coldly, "Goodbye mother, you hate tardiness", I bowed and left.
 
 She wouldn't see my tears, I've promised myself. This lady behind me won't see those tears because I am strong. Strong enough to be broken one day. 
 
 I thought school should have been fun, but with her unending rules, it's a death sentence. 
 
  One I'll live everyday before I garner enough strength to break free.
 
  Free from pressure
 
  Competition placed amongst us
 
 Withholding friends and turning us to enemies who would do anything to survive. 
 
  The rich ain't always happy.
 
  We cry too.
 
 Because we seek the happiness that is parallel to our wealth.
 
 Peace
  The undefined. 
 
 
 Chator Peace...
